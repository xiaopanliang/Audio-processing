%  Usage: [Pxy, Pxxy] = gmihmm_prob(alpha,beta,scale,A,mu,sigma,Y)
%
% Input:
%   Y		observation vector sequence [ dim x time ]
%   A		state transition probabilities [ to x from ]
%   P0		initial state probabilities [ state x 1 ]
%   mu		observation mean [ dim x mixture x state ]
%   sigma		observation variance: diagonal [ dim x mixture x state ]
%		                      full [ dim x dim x mixture x state ]
