%  Usage: [alpha,scale] = ghmm_fwd(y,Pss,Ps0,Q,C,R,wS,wY)
%
% Input:
%   y		observation vector sequence [ dim x time ]
%   A		state transition probabilities [ to x from ]
%   P0		initial state probabilities [ state x 1 ]
%   mu		observation mean [ dim x mixture x state ]
%   sigma		observation variance: diagonal [ dim x mixture x state ]
%		                      full [ dim x dim x mixture x state ]
% Output:

%   scale	log Pr( s_0, ..., s_t | observation sequence up to time 't')
