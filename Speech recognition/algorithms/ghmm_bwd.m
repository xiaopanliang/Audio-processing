% gmihmm_bwd -- Gaussian mixture HMM backward state estimation 
%            (backward probability propagation)
%
% Usage: beta = gmihmm_bwd(Y,A,P0,mu,sigma,scale)
%
% Input:
%   Y		observation vector sequence [ dim x time ]
%   A		state transition probabilities [ to x from ]
%   P0		initial state probabilities [ state x 1 ]
%   mu		observation mean [ dim x mixture x state ]
%   sigma		observation variance: diagonal [ dim x mixture x state ]
%		                      full [ dim x dim x mixture x state ]
%   scale	see 'ghmm_fwd'
% Output:
%   beta	Pr( s_t, observation sequence from time 't+1')
